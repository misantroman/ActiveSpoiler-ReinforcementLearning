# Active Rear Automotice Spoiler Control Based on Reinforcement Learning

Algorithms were implemented in a Robotic handmade designed, with an onboard Raspberry4 computer.

Active spoiler controlled with Deep Q-network with the objective of  reducing  the lateral acceleration felt by the car in curves. 

Conclusions, an Deep Q-network algorithm will find the best way to achieve the current scenery, the agent is the spoiler.
The implemented system achieves to reduce the acceleration,
is expected that in a real car it would perform better results, than in a small prototype due to the perturbations.
